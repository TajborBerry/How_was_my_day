## ðŸ“Œ Actions
Based on the feature importance score of my model I made the following changes:  
    1. Enrolled in a gym membership to improve physical well-being.  
    2. Structured weekly chores into a planned schedule rather than performing them ad hoc.  
    3. Established an early bedtime alarm to promote better sleep habits.
